The Kobeissi Letter

The Oracle situation:

Oracle, $ORCL, is down over -11% after hours following earnings results which have sent the entire AI trade lower.

Futures are down -1% right now. But, is it warranted?

First, Oracle RAISED CapEx estimates by $15 BILLION for 2026.

Raising CapEx guidance has been rewarded by investors all year, so what changed?

The biggest concern right now is Oracle's debt situation; investors are worried about how this CapEx will be financed.

The important point here is that Oracle is borrowing because DEMAND is skyrocketing, and debt is cheaper than missing the AI Revolution.

This is the exact playbook that both Microsoft and Amazon used in 2012-2017.

Furthermore, Oracle's debt load is still manageable with leverage multiples below a lot of its peers.

In our view, this is just another case of the sentiment pendulum swinging back in the direction of "AI is a bubble" after a hot rally and a dovish Fed meeting.

The after hours move in tech stocks seems to be an overreaction.

We still expect asset owners to win.
